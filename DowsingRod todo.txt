Plan v1
-	Dowsing works by 100 random distance ray casts per frame in a cone up to 1000 blocks
-	When a hit is detected, the rod jumps slightly
-	Rods use up mana quickly
-	A rod must be 'charged' by touching an instance of the object (or mob) in question to divine its position
-	Charges are permanent
-	Dowsing Rod
	-	Recipe: Ebonwood/Crimwood, Lens, Feather, Active Stone Block
	-	Detects any basic block/ore type
-	Vining Rod
	-	Recipe: Dowsing Rod, Vines, Amber
	-	Detects non-basic block types (objects); e.g. Strange Plants, Life Crystals, Chests, and Statues (any)
-	Witching Rod
	-	Recipe: Dowsing Rod, Guide Voodoo Doll, Purification Powder
	-	"Detects" rare mobs nearby (see Divining Rod)
-	Divining Rod
	-	Recipe: Vining Rod, Witching Rod, Throne
	-	"Detects" mobs with rare items
	-	An invisible point is placed randomly offscreen where the rare item mob is "supposed" to be
	-	If an instance of the mob in question happens to be at that point, it is "chosen" to drop a rare item
	-	When the point enters the screen, it is re-randomized to another place offscreen
	-	Each re-randomization increases the radius of the mob selector
-	Plan for psychokinetic charge
	-	40 "dowsing beam" tracer rays are used in a cone up to 250 units long, and 100 units wide at the end
	-	The nearest object hit by a beam is selected to receive a 'charge'
	-	Each charge adds a 15 second debuff that does 20 damage at the end of the debuff timer
	-	Each successive charge adds +7 seconds and +20 damage to the debuff, up to 30 times
